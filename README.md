# Overview

This project is a machine learning application developed in Python, utilizing the Flask framework to serve predictions on housing prices. The project is set up with Azure Pipelines for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), enabling automated testing and deployment to Azure App Service. 

Overall, this project demonstrates a practical implementation of a machine learning application with a focus on automation, containerization, and cloud deployment, showcasing modern development practices and tools.
